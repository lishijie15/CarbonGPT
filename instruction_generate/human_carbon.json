    "value": "Given the historical data for load, photovoltaic generation and wind generation over 12 time steps in a specific region of Colorado State, the recorded load is [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], the recorded photovoltaic generation is [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0], and the recorded wind generation is [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]. The recording time of the historical data is 'October 01, 2016, 00:00, Saturday to October 02, 2016, 00:00, Sunday, with data points recorded at 1-hour intervals'. Here is the region information: This region is located within the state of Colorado and encompasses a large number of load, photovoltaic generation and wind generation nodes within an 8.5-kilometer radius, covering urban residential, suburban residential, community-distributed photovoltaic generation, randomly distributed photovoltaic generation, and large suburban distributed wind generation. Now we want to predict the load, photovoltaic generation and wind generation for the next 12 time steps during the time period of ' October 02, 2016, 01:00, Sunday to October 02, 2016, 06:00, Sunday, with data points recorded at 1-hour intervals'. To improve prediction accuracy, a spatio-temporal model is utilized to encode the historical load, photovoltaic generation and wind generation data as tokens <ST_HIS>, where the first, the second and the third tokens correspond to the representations of load, photovoltaic generation and wind generation. Please note that in the analysis process, it is essential to take into account the provided time and regional information, and then generate the predictive tokens for regression, in the form \"<ST_PRE>\"."
